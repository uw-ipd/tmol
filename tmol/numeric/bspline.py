B-splines can be used for interpolation, using only as much space
as the original data, after the original data is processed to produce
coefficients for the polynomials. When interpolating, B-splines read from
as much memory as bicublic-spline interpolation does (e.g. 16 values
in 2D, 64 values in 3D), but they read from a wider number of grid cells
to do so, instead of making each grid cell contain more entries. For this
reason, the memory footprint for B-splines is substantially lower than
that for bicuplic spline interpolation. (Catmull-Rom splines are similarly
low-memory overhead, but do not fit the data as cleanly).

To use these B-splines, construct a BSplineInterpolation object using the
``from_coordinates`` function, passing in the tensor of coordinates that
should be interpolated, indicating the degree of the spline (3 for
the equivalent of bicubic spline interpolation), and indicating the
number of dimensions in the coordinate tensor that are indexing rather
than interpolating. (Indexing dimensions must appear first). Indexing
dimensions allow stacks of coordinate tensors to be interpolated
simultaneously as might be useful, e.g., if one had 20 different 36x36
tables as one does when computing the Ramachandran potential.

Interpolation is performed where the input X values must be in the range of
(0, len(X_i)] for dimension i -- if, e.g., you are interpolating dihedrals
in degrees with a 10 degree step size in the range (-180, 180], then add 180
to the dihedral shifting to the range [0, 360) and then divide by 10 to produce
an interpolation value in the range (0, 36]. Another way to say this is that
the code assumes a uniform unit distance between interpolation points.

    and not interpolation dimensions. The indexing dimensions should appear as the
    most significant dimensions and the interpolating dimensions should appear as the

    ``X`` (and if the original coordinate tensor had indexing dimensions, a tensor of
    indices ``Y``) to produce a tensor of interpolated values.
