r"""Graph components managing dispatch of "intra" and "inter" layer scoring.

Score evaluation involves the interaction of three types:

(a) A `_ScoreComponent`, defining a single system state.
(b) An `IntraScore`, managing the total intra-system score for a
    single system.
(c) An `IntraScore`, managing the total inter-system score for a pair
    of systems.

The ``_ScoreComponent`` type is instantiated once for a group of related scoring
operations, and is responsible for initializing any static or reusable data
required to score a system. The system state (Eg: atomic coordinates) is
updated via assignment for each score operation, preserving the ``System``
object.

The ``[Intra|Inter]Score`` types are instantiated for each score operation, and
are responsible for evaluating the score for a single system state using state
data stored within the ``System`` object.  A single ``[Intra|Inter]Score``
object is created for every scoring pass, and is not reused.

All types are defined via a composition of multiple term-specific components,
and a term contributes a component to each of the three types under a common
term "name". The ``[Inter|Intra]Score`` component exposes a term-specific
``total_<term>`` property, which are summed to produce a final ``total``
property.

To "simplify" the definition of concrete scoring classes from a composite of
score component base classes, the ``IntraScore`` and ``InterScore`` types are
dynamically derived from the ``_ScoreComponent`` type via inspection of the
``_ScoreComponent`` MRO, gathering base components for the ``IntraScore`` and
``InterScore`` classes. Note that this results in a unsettling inversion of
ownership between classes and instances: ``_ScoreComponent`` types define class
level references to their ``IntraScore`` and ``InterScore`` counterparts, but
the resulting ``intra_score` and ``inter_score`` *objects* contain references
to a target ``_ScoreComponent`` object.
