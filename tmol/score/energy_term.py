        Make a one-time annotation on the block type. These annotations will
        probably require string comparison and may be slow; they should be
        performed only once, so the EnergyTerm must check that its annotation
        is not already present in the block type. Annotations should be in
        numpy data structures (and stored on the CPU).

        If the annotation requires more than one array, then the EnergyTerm
        should use a python class to store those arrays. E.g.,
        class FooSet:
            foo_array1: NDArray[numpy.int32][:]
            foo_array2: NDArray[numpy.int32][:, :]

        If the kind of annotation made depends on data that may change
        between different instances of the same term, then the annotation
        should be a map whose key is a function of the perhaps-changing
        data. The term should calculate that key at its construction to
        make retrieval efficient. (Any such data that sways how the
        calculation is made should never change over the lifetime of the

        Make a one-time annotation of the packed-block types. This annotation
        should mostly involve concatenating the previously-made numpy annotations
        on the block types that the packed-block types contains. E.g. if the
        EnergyTerm annotates the block types with an i-dimensional array "foo,"
        then it should also annotate the PackedBlockTypes with an (i+1)-dimensional
        tensor "foo" where the first dimension will index across the different
        block types in foo in the order that those block types appear in the
        PackedBlockTypes' list of active block types. Sometimes the size of the
        i-dimensional arrays will differ between block types; the (i+1)-dimensional
        tensor should be dimensioned to the maximal size for each of the i dimensions
        among the set of dimensions of the various block types. The extra padding
        in such cases is recommended to be filled with a sentinel value of -1.

        As with the block type annotation, if more than one tensor is required,
        then the annotation should be a class. If the annotation is based on
        data that might differ between instances, then the annotation should be
        a map whose keys are determined by the data.

        The EnergyMethod should begin by checking that it has not already made
        this annotation. Any array data in the annotation should be torch
        tensors and should live on the PackedBlockTypes' device.
