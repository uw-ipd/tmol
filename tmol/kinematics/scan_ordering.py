    """Partitioning of a tree into linear subpaths.

    The tree is stored as a list of pointers to parent indices, with an
    arbitrary set of roots.  Each root implies a connected subtree.
    Each index i has a parent index (p_i) "higher" in the tree (p_i < i).
    The tree structure is fully defined by parent pointers, an index array
    (parent) of len(tree_size) where parent[i] == i for all root nodes.

    The source tree implies a per-node child list of length >= 0, defined by
    all nodes for which the given node is a parent. Nodes with no children are
    leaves.

    Scan paths cuts the tree into linear paths, where each non-leaf node (i)
    has a *single* child (c_i) "lower" in the tree (i < c_i). The path
    structure is fully defined by child pointers, an index array (subpath_child)
    of subpath_child[i] == c_i (non-leaves) or subpath_child[i] = -1 (leaves).

    The path partitioning implies "subpath roots", the set of nodes which are
    *not* the subpath child of their parent (subpath_child[parent[i]] != i).

    Each path in the tree is labeled with a depth: a path with depth
    i may depend on the values computed for atoms with depths 0..i-1.
    All of the paths of the same depth can be processed in a single
    kernel execution with segmented scan.

    """Scan plans for parallel kinematic operations.

    The KinTreeScanOrdering class divides the tree into a set of paths. Along
    each path is a continuous chain of atoms that either (1) require their
    coordinate frames computed as a cumulative product of homogeneous
    transforms for the coordinate update algorithm, or (2) require the
    cumulative sum of their f1f2 vectors for the derivative calculation
    algorithm. In both cases, these paths can be processed efficiently
    on the GPU using an algorithm called "scan" and batches of these paths
    can be processed at once in a variant called "segmented scan."

    The same set of paths is used for both the refold algorithm and
    the derivative summation; the refold algorithm starts at path
    roots and multiplies homogeneous transforms towards the leaves.
    The derivative summation algorithm starts at the leaves and sums
    upwards towards the roots.

    To accomplish this, the GPUKinTreeReordering class reorders the atoms from
    the original KinTree order ("ko") where atoms are known by their
    kintree-index ("ki") into 1) their refold order ("ro") where atoms are
    known by their refold index ("ri") and 2) their deriv-sum order ("dso")
    where atoms are known by their deriv-sum index.

    Each scan operation is performed as a series of depth-based "generations",
    in which the scans at generation n are *only* dependent on the results of
    scans in generations [0...n-1] inclusive. In the forward-scan generations
    are ordered from the kinematic root, and scan segments begin with a value
    derived from the result of a generation [0...n-1] scan. In the
    backward-scan generations are ordered from kinematic leaves, and scan
    segments pull summation results from multiple generation [0...n-1] scans.
