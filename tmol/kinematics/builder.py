class KinematicBuilder:
    """Supports assembly of sets of bonded atoms into a valid KinForest.

    Usage: invoke KinematicBuilder.append_connected_components with the outputs from
    KinematicBuilder.define_trees_with_prioritized_bonds and retrieve the kinforest
    from the resulting KinematicBuilder object.

    The primary way in which KinForests are built is to provide bonds_to_forest with
    the set of *potential* (directed) edges between atoms in individual trees as well
    as the list of root atoms, one for each tree in the forest. If certain bonds
    should be included for whatever reason (e.g., they hold the DOFs that the
    user will likely optimize), then these can be given as *prioritized* edges.
    E.g., for proline, you would list CA-CB and CB-CG as prioritized edges, and list
    CA-CB, CB-CG, CG-CD, and CD-N as potential edges.

    Prioritzed edges are not guaranteed to end up in the KinForest, however.
    If any prioritized edge is absent from the set of potential
    edges, then it will not be included in the tree. A prioritized
    edge must also be a potential edge to be included. Thus it is
    safe to list as priority edges the bonds for all named torsions in a PoseStack
    even if some of those bonds span cutpoints. As long as the cutpoint edges
    are not listed in the set of potential edges.

    (Thus the FoldForest should be consulted when figuring out which inter-
    block bonds should be included in the potential edges, but it does not
    need to be consulted when figuring out which named torsions should
    be included in the prioritized edges.)

    For both the potential- and priority edges, it is safe to include both
    (a,b) and (b,a) as at most one of the pair will appear in the resulting
    forest.

    Internally, the builder is going to connect the root atoms together to
    calculate a minimum spanning tree, before removing the connections
    between the root atoms.

    Deprecated as it is inefficient:
    Provides utility methods to perform incremental assembly of sets of bonded
    atoms ("connected components") into a valid KinForest. This involves
    determination of a spanning DAG for the component beginning from a
    specified root atom, initialization of reference frames for each atom, and
    concatenation of this component onto the KinForest.
