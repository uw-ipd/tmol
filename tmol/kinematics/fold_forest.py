    Each tensor in the class has its first dimension over the number of poses.

    The primary definition of a FoldTree is the Edge. The Edge defines a connection
    between two parts of a Pose. The two most commonly used edges are PolymerEdges
    (analgous to the previously named PeptideEdges from Rosetta++ and Rosetta3) and
    JumpEdges. A polymer edge spans a contiguous range of polymeric block types where
    the "up" connection of residue i is connected to the "down" connection of residue
    i+1 for all i in the range between the "start" and "end" blocks.

    Not sure yet what I want this class to do or how I want to construct it;
    should it be unmodifyable or should it let you add edges?
