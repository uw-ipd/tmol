`tmol` environment dependencies are organized into rough layers for `core`
run deps, `test` suite deps, `docs` build deps and `dev` interactive
development deps. These layers are maintained to enable specification of
a minimal set of runtime dependencies, while still allowing broad use of
external libraries for test and development.

## Setup

All environments are managed via `conda`, however not all external
packages may be available as conda packages. Requirements lists are split
into `dependencies.txt` and `requirements.txt`, specifying `conda`-managed
conda dependencies and `pip`-managed pypi requirements respectively.
Non-default conda channels are managed via (preferably) specification of
the package channel via the {channel}::{package} syntax within
"dependencies.txt" or (less preferably) globally enabling the channel at
a given installation layer via "channels.txt".

The `render` script is used to generate an `environment.yml` file for use
via `conda env update -f environment.yml`. See `render --help` for
details.

The `core`-level requirement is augmented via the `linux.cpu`,
`linux.cuda` or `osx.cpu` platform-specific sub files, allowing
installation of a cpu-only or cpu-and-cuda environment.

## Adding Dependencies

Follow these ~~simple~~ steps to add a new dependency:

1. Identify the lowest level / first dependency layer from the following:

  * `core` - Referenced by the `tmol` package.
  * `{platform}.core` - Referenced by cuda-specific components of the
    `tmol` package.
  * `test` - Referenced by the `tmol.tests` package.
  * `support` - Referenced by the `tmol.support` package.
  * `docs` - Referenced under `docs`.
  * `dev`  - Referenced under `dev`.

2. Determine the dependency source. If the package is available under
   a "standard" conda channel (not `conda-forge`) then include as
   a `.dependencies` reference. Elif available on PyPI include include as
   a `.requirements` reference. Iff the package is only available via
   a custom https channel, (eg. http://conda.ipd.uw.edu) then include
   this channel via a `.channels` reference

3. Verify that the dependency isn't specified on multiple levels. (Eg.
   Moved from `dev` to `core`.) `grep` is your friend.

4. Test and verify the rendered `environment.yml` file.

## Test Environment

The "standard" tmol test environment is specified via a docker image under
`test/Dockerfile`. This environment is used for *all* CI test steps, and
includes the `test` and `docs` environment layers.
