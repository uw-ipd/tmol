# ToyMol

`tmol` is an ongoing development experiment in biomolecular modeling and
design. We stand on the shoulders of giants, with the goal of implementing
an equivalent version of the [Rosetta all atom energy
function](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00125) via
a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)/[PyData](https://pydata.org) stack to
provide a modern, easy-to-use, and cuda-compatible for molecular modeling.

See our [wiki](./wiki) for details on our development environment, system
architecture, and development workflow.
